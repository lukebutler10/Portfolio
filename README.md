# Luke Butler - Portfolio

By the way here's the link to this page https://lukebutler10.github.io/Portfolio/

### [Project 1 - Backpropagation from scratch](https://github.com/lukebutler10/backpropagation_from_scratch/tree/master)

In this notebook I created a simple neural network that uses backpropagation to improve it's predictive capability. I used the MNIST database which is a collection of handwriten digits. The aim of the model is to predict the number written in each image. The neural network that I utilised was a simple one - it had one hidden layer anf the activation functions used were ReLu and Softmax. 

The purpose of this was to give a clearer insight into the mathematics behind neural networks and how each step is performed. It can be easy to make use of neural networks in Python through libraries like Tensorflow without actually thinking about how the network is formed and how the model is improved. It gives the user a high-level look at how NNâ€™s can be applied but I wanted to understand the actual process of improving predictions through training. For that I decided to code a model from scratch, just using Pandas and Numpy. All the formulae that is used has been created in individual functions with most of them employing simple mathematical equations.


### [Project 2 - Income prediction using KNN algorithm](https://github.com/lukebutler10/KNN_Income_Prediction)

In this project my aim was to predict annual income. Income is influenced by various factors such as education level, age, gender and occupation. Extracting data from a public dataset which had these variables and more along with income, I used the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to predict income.


### [Project 3 - YouTube channel Data Anlaysis](https://github.com/lukebutler10/youtube_data_analysis)

In this project I conduct some exploratory data analysis on a selection of YouTube videos. I aim to find out if there are any key indicators with a link to the popularity of videos. This interested me as it is a tool that content creators could use during the process of making their videos to improve performance. I explore some potential relationships between variables such as which key features of a video can indictate higher views. The YouTube channels that I choose to analyse were all travel vloggers as these are videos that I was interested at the time of creating the project!
